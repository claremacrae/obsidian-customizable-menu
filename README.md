# Obsidian Customizable Right Click Menu

This plugin allows you to add any commands, including those of plugins, to the right click menu and assign custom icons to them.

## Custom Icons

If the command doesn't yet have any icon, you can select from a range of icons, including Obsidian's internal icons and all Feather Icons.

## Limitations

**Note:** Commands are only added to the editor's right-click menu **when in Edit mode**. They are not visible in Preview Mode.
Looks like it only works when clicking a note in edit mode. This should be mentioned in the description.


## Thanks
This plugin is a fork of phibr0's excellent [customizable sidebar](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-customizable-sidebar).
